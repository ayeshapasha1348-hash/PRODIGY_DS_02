# PRODIGY_DS_02 - Student Performance Analysis

This project is part of my Data Science Internship (Task 2). In this task, I worked on the **Student Performance Dataset** to perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal
Analyze student performance to gain insights into study habits, gender distribution, attendance patterns, and correlations with final grades.

---

## 🗂 Dataset Info
Dataset: `Student_performance_updated_1000.csv`  
Key columns include:
- Student ID
- Gender
- Study Hours
- Attendance
- Final Grade
- Other performance indicators

---

## 📌 Files Included
1. **Student_performance_updated_1000.csv** – Dataset used for analysis  
2. **student_analysis.py / student_analysis.ipynb** – Python code for EDA and visualization  
3. **study_hours_histogram.png** – Histogram of study hours  
4. **gender_distribution.png** – Gender distribution chart  
5. **attendance_vs_final_grade.png** – Scatter plot of attendance vs final grade  
6. **correlation_heatmap.png** – Correlation heatmap of dataset features
